          The rollback function restores the Omnia core to the last backup version
          created during upgrade, including configs and container state.

          To return to the previous Omnia version
          {{("(version " ~ backup_version[0] ~ ")") if backup_version is defined and backup_version }}
          captured in the backup,
          run the rollback from the OIM host:
            1) If you are inside the Omnia core container, exit the container shell.
            2) On the OIM host prompt, execute: ./omnia.sh --rollback
